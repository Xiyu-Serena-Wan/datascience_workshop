This is fucking hard!!! As usual, I spent half of my time watching algorithms on Youtube, and spent the other half of my time creating my own file. It turns out I only did Code Replicability before, and I'm only qualified to do this instead of creating my own. I learnt that, next time, I would replicate some first before I would write my own. 

I stuck in some trivial errors today. Like trying to use to same methods forcefully without thinking the minor difference on formatting. It's odd though, you will never know what errors come next. It's easy to be stuck in errors, since errors are successive, means that if you solve one, others will come. The changes you've made to solve the first a few errors ,function not as much as you thought, lead to more structural mistakes. Therefore, never stuck in one error for too long. If it cannot be solved, then study other's code.
